# sed (Stream Editor) Cheat Sheet

# Basic Syntax
sed [options] 'command' file            # Apply sed command to a file
sed [options] -e 'command' -e 'command' file # Apply multiple sed commands

# Common Options
-e script      # Add the script to the commands to be executed
-f file        # Add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed
-n             # Suppress automatic printing of pattern space
-i             # Edit files in-place (makes changes to the file)

# Addressing Lines
1              # First line
$              # Last line
1,10           # Lines from 1 to 10
/pattern/      # Lines matching pattern
1,/pattern/    # From line 1 to matching pattern

# Basic Commands
p              # Print the current pattern space
d              # Delete pattern space; start next cycle
s/pattern/replacement/ # Substitute pattern with replacement
s/pattern/replacement/g # Substitute all occurrences of pattern

# Regular Expressions
.              # Any single character
*              # Zero or more of the preceding element
^              # Start of line
$              # End of line
[abc]          # Any character listed between the brackets
[^abc]         # Any character not listed between the brackets

# Examples
sed 's/unix/linux/' file.txt          # Replace first occurrence of 'unix' with 'linux' in each line
sed 's/unix/linux/g' file.txt         # Replace all occurrences of 'unix' with 'linux'
sed '/unix/d' file.txt                # Delete lines containing 'unix'
sed '5d' file.txt                     # Delete line 5
sed '2,4d' file.txt                   # Delete lines from 2 to 4
sed -n '5p' file.txt                  # Print only line 5
sed -n '1,5p' file.txt                # Print lines 1 to 5
sed 's/unix/linux/2' file.txt         # Replace the second occurrence of 'unix' with 'linux'
sed -i 's/unix/linux/g' file.txt      # Replace all occurrences of 'unix' with 'linux' in file in-place
sed '1,5s/unix/linux/g' file.txt      # Replace 'unix' with 'linux' from line 1 to 5

# Advanced Examples
sed -e '1d' -e 's/unix/linux/' file.txt # Combine multiple commands with -e
sed -n '/pattern/p' file.txt            # Print only lines that match pattern
sed '/^#/d' file.txt                    # Delete all lines starting with '#'
sed '/^$/d' file.txt                    # Delete all empty lines
sed 'G' file.txt                        # Append a blank line after each line
