# Penetration Testing Cheat Sheet for Linux

# Information Gathering
whois domain.com               # Whois query for domain information
dig domain.com                 # DNS lookup
dig -x host                    # Reverse DNS lookup
nmap -v -A target              # Network mapping and port scanning
theHarvester -d domain.com -b all # Gather emails, subdomains, hosts, etc.

# Network and Port Analysis
netstat -tuln                  # List active connections and listening ports
tcpdump -i eth0                # Capture packets on a network interface
wireshark                      # GUI network protocol analyzer
hping3                         # Packet generator and analyzer

# Vulnerability Analysis
nikto -h target                # Web server scanner
sqlmap -u "url" --forms --batch # Automated SQL injection tool
OpenVAS                        # Vulnerability scanning tool
yara                           # Create and run file scanning rules

# Wireless Network Tools
airmon-ng                      # Enable monitor mode on wireless interfaces
airodump-ng mon0               # Capture packets from a wireless network
aireplay-ng                    # Inject frames into a wireless network
aircrack-ng                    # Crack WEP and WPA PSK keys

# Exploitation Tools
metasploit-framework           # Advanced open-source platform for developing, testing, and using exploit code
msfvenom -p payload LHOST=host LPORT=port -f format # Create a specific payload
sqlmap -u "url" --dbms=dbms --dump # SQL injection and database takeover tool

# Password Attacks
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt file # Password cracking tool
hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://192.168.0.1 # Online password attack tool
hashcat -m 500 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt # Advanced password recovery

# Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development
gdb /path/to/binary            # GNU Debugger
radare2 /path/to/binary        # Open-source reverse engineering framework
IDA Pro                         # Disassembler and debugger

# Post Exploitation
nc -lvp port                   # Netcat listener
nc target port                 # Netcat client
msfconsole                     # Metasploit console
setoolkit                      # Social-Engineering Toolkit for phishing attacks

# Forensics Tools
foremost -i image.dd           # Recover files using their headers, footers, and data structures
binwalk -E file                # Analyze and extract firmware images
volatility                     # Memory forensics framework

# Scripting and Automation
curl -X GET "url"              # Transfer data from or to a server
wget -r -l 3 "url"             # Recursively download files from a web directory
bash script.sh                 # Execute a bash script
python script.py               # Execute a Python script

# Security and Anonymity
tor                            # Anonymous network routing
proxychains command            # Force any command to follow through proxy
iptables -L -n -v              # List all iptables rules
